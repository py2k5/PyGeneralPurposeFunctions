1.  2 - sum problem
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        lookup_map = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            
            if complement in lookup_map:
                return [ lookup_map[complement], i ]
            else:
                lookup_map[nums[i]] = i
